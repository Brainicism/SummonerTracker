An Android application that runs in the background and sends notifications whenever a tracked user enters a game. There is an optional notification for when the user finishes their game. 
You can click on a finished game notification to be directed towards to their detailed match history. 

Development has ceased for this project, but the application is fully functional assuming it has a stable internet connection (e.g. no switching between wi-fi and data).
